# Preface
This is my attempt on the TODO list. This is a Submission for Web Dev team to get me into Web Dev team. **Please Select Me**. ~~I may not know how to setup and test `PUT`, `DELETE` etc., methods, but I've done my best using just `GET` and `POST`.~~ **`GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` Should all work now, but it has not been tested yet.** I have done my best to do it. I assure you, I will learn more after joining the team and be MORE productive. Thank you `:D`
# Setup
_Preferred Working Environment WSL._
1. Install [bun](www.bun.sh)
2. Run `bun spine.js`
# Important Info
Server Should run in [localhost](127.0.0.1:6969) (GitHub don't support these links http://127.0.0.1:6969). Read the implementation [documented in this file](/spine.js). Rigorously tested using `curl`. I could not deploy it `:(`
## The Next Day
Tested using Python Script and Recorded the results
